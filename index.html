            <p class="description">We first structured the website and styling with the CSS framework Bulma. Utilizing
                the National Park Service API and OpenWeather API we built an application that will display National
                Parks with a 5-Day Forecast to match for each park. Upon selecting a state from the drop down, you will
                be shown a list of the parks coordinating with that state. Next to the park, there is a button to
                display the weather in a modal. Below said list will be an image from the park, a description of the
                park, and some contact info for that park with a link to the parks website. Each state you select will
                be saved to local storage and shown as a button that will take you to that list of parks for that state.
